# [ATT&CK] Clear Windows Event Logs (T1070.001) — Security Log Cleared

**Platform:** Windows  
**ATT&CK Technique:** T1070.001 — Indicator Removal on Host: Clear Windows Event Logs  
**Tactic(s):** Defense Evasion  
**Severity:** High  
**Data Sources:** Windows Security (EventCode=1102), Sysmon, Endpoint logs


## Detection Logic (SPL)
```spl
index=wineventlog sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=1102
| eval user=coalesce(SubjectUserName, Account_Name)
| stats count AS clears by Computer, user, _time
| sort -_time
```
## Rationale
Clearing Windows Event Logs is a classic technique used by adversaries to cover their tracks and hinder forensic analysis. This detection identifies instances where the Security event log (Event ID 1102) is cleared, which requires administrative privileges.

---

## Triage
- Review which user performed the action, was it a legitimate admin or unexpected account?
- Check for preceding suspicious events on the same host (privilege escalation, service creation, lateral movement).
- Correlate with Sysmon or EDR telemetry to identify what occurred before and after the log clear.

## Response
- Isolate the affected host immediately to prevent further log tampering.
- Preserve volatile data (memory, running processes) for forensic analysis.
- Rotate credentials associated with the account that cleared the logs.
- Conduct a full host triage for persistence and privilege abuse indicators.

## Notes/False Positives
- Some legitimate maintenance or scripted log rotation processes may trigger EventCode 1102.
- Verify timing against scheduled maintenance or patching windows before raising an incident.
